# 🚀 Doubly Linked List & Problem-Solving

Welcome to the **Doubly Linked List** repository! This project is a custom-built implementation of a **doubly linked list** in C++ with various operations and problem-solving utilities. 💡

## 📌 Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| ✅ Insert | Add elements at the beginning, end, or after a specific node 📥 |
| ❌ Delete | Remove first, last, or specific nodes 🗑️ |
| 🔍 Search | Find elements in the list quickly 🔎 |
| 🔄 Reverse | Reverse the linked list for better manipulation 🔃 |
| 📏 Size | Get the number of elements in the list 📊 |
| 📌 Update | Modify values at specific indices ✏️ |
| 🖨️ Print | Display the list contents easily 📝 |

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

### 🔧 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/aboubakr-jelloulat/DSA_project1.git
   cd doubly-linked-list
   ```
2. Include the header file in your project:
   ```cpp
   #include "clsDblLinkedList.h"
   ```

### 🚀 Usage Example
```cpp
clsDblLinkedList<int> myList;
myList.InsertAtBeginning(10);
myList.InsertAtEnd(20);
myList.PrintList(); // Output: 10 20
```
