# 🚀 Doubly Linked List & Problem-Solving

Welcome to the **Doubly Linked List** repository! This project is a custom-built implementation of a **doubly linked list** in C++ with various operations and problem-solving utilities. 💡

## 📌 Features

✅ Insert at the beginning, end, or after a specific node  
✅ Delete nodes (first, last, or specific)  
✅ Search for a value 🔍  
✅ Reverse the linked list 🔄  
✅ Check if the list is empty  
✅ Get and update values by index  
✅ Clear the entire list 🗑️  
✅ Print the list 🖨️  

## 🛠️ Installation & Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/doubly-linked-list.git
   cd doubly-linked-list
   ```
2. Include the header file in your project:
   ```cpp
   #include "clsDblLinkedList.h"
   ```
3. Example Usage:
   ```cpp
   clsDblLinkedList<int> myList;
   myList.InsertAtBeginning(10);
   myList.InsertAtEnd(20);
   myList.PrintList(); // Output: 10 20
   ```

## 🎯 Problem-Solving with Linked Lists
This repository also includes **problem-solving exercises** using the doubly linked list, helping you master data structures and algorithms! 💡🔥
